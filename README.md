# JavaScript Chaining

In this example, if you want to use more than one jQuery method on the same selection of elements, you can list several methods at a time using dot notation to separate each one, as shown below. In this one statement, three methods act on the same selection of elements: hide() hides the elements, delay() creates a pause, fadeIn() fades in the elements. The process of placing several methods in the same selector is referred to as chaining. As you can see, it results in code that is far more compact.
